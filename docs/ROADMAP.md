# AdMirable â€“ Project Roadmap

## Current Status (v1.0)
- **Core**: Browser extension stubs ad detection, minimal Node.js/Express backend, React dashboard for user management.
- **Auth**: JWT-based login/registration, hashed passwords.
- **Donations**: Basic system with a `Donation` model.

## Phase 1: Stabilization
- **Improve Ad Detection**: Possibly partner with ad networks or use advanced pattern recognition.
- **Finalize Payment Flow**: Integrate with real payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, or crypto).
- **Extension Polishing**: Store user settings, handle errors gracefully, add optional auto-donate toggles.

## Phase 2: Partnerships & Scaling
- **Partner Websites**: Official collaboration with publishers to share their ad revenue or integrate custom scripts.
- **Charity Enrollment**: Provide a portal for charities to sign up and verify their details.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time statistics on total donations, user metrics, etc.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Mobile Integration**: Expand to Android or iOS via a specialized ad-block/redirect plugin or a custom browser.
- **Blockchain-based Ledger**: Immutable donation records for complete transparency.
- **Machine Learning**: Personalized charity suggestions based on user's cause preferences or browsing habits.
- **Gamification**: Achievements, donation milestones, badges, and social sharing.

## Phase 4: Global Rollout
- **Regional Compliance**: Address GDPR, CCPA, and local donation regulations.
- **Local Currencies**: Multi-currency support to handle donations worldwide with minimal conversion fees.
- **Community Governance**: Possibly allow open discussion or voting on which new charities to onboard.
